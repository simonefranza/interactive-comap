Often, those adjustments are inadequate and remain too close to the original anchor, which is a problem when the  anchor is very different from the true answer. For example: During hiring negotiations, a hiring manager might consider offering a very low compensation package to a prospective candidate. Now, because of the lower starting point, the candidate might end up joining at a relatively lower initial salary even after several rounds of negotiation.",

Once the value of the anchor is set, subsequent arguments, estimates,  etc. made by an individual may change from what they would have otherwise been without the anchor. For example, an individual may be more likely to purchase a car if it is placed alongside a more expensive model (the anchor). Prices discussed in negotiations that are lower than the anchor may seem reasonable, perhaps even cheap to the buyer, even if said prices are still relatively higher than the actual market  value of the car.",
